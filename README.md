This project was created as a final project in Coding for Digital Storytelling at Northeastern University as part of the Media Innovation and Data Communication Master's program. The project was created by Elijah Nicholson-Messmer. The project was created using the following tools:

* [AI2HTML](http://ai2html.org/)
* [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellsamora/scrollama)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

Special thanks to Professor Rahul Bhargava for his guidance and support throughout the project. And to Jonathan Soma for his incredibly helpful [tutorials](https://github.com/jsoma?tab=repositories&q=ai2html&type=&language=&sort=) on using AI2HTML with Scrollama.
